# Airportitlwm-kext
An IO80211 added version of Airportitlwm.  
This is same as zxystd's Airportitlwm  
But it is put in IO80211Family.kext to make sure Clover and OC 0.6.0 and lower can use it.  
All bugs should open issues on zxystd's master branch.
   
# Caution
1.This kext can't load if your OpenCore's SecureBootModel is Disabled. You should set it to Default.
